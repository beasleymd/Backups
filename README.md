Requirements
A git repository, private, not public like I use for testing here should be established. An SSH key should be used to prevent the script from prompting for credentails. This key should be fairly easy to setup. Also your repo clone should be in the form git@xxx.com:account/repo so that it will use SSH to pull and push.
